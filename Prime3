It is important to note that clashes can occur in various other areas as well, depending on the specific cultural practices and interactions between the civilizations.

Each civilization on JunJia is believed to have evolved in response to the unique environmental conditions of their respective regions. The distinct topographical features and challenges posed by the planet's diverse landscapes played a significant role in shaping the physical attributes, cultural practices, and social structures of each civilization.
The Occulans, residing in the dense forests, likely evolved with an emphasis on visual acuity and intellectual pursuits. Their tall and slender stature, along with their large eyes, could be adaptations to navigating the intricate forest environment, allowing them to perceive details and colors beyond ordinary human capabilities. Over time, their deep connection to nature and their advanced knowledge of medicine and science may have developed as a result of their exposure to the diverse flora and fauna of the forests.
The Audorms, inhabiting the vast deserts, may have evolved with physical characteristics and adaptations suited to the arid environment. Their rugged and leathery skin, along with their acute hearing, could be adaptations to withstand the harsh desert conditions. The strict hierarchical structure and emphasis on military might may have emerged as a response to the challenges of survival and resource scarcity in the deserts.
The Flarents, dwelling in the frozen tundras, likely evolved with physical traits and adaptations to endure the extreme cold and harsh conditions of their environment. Their stocky build, thick fur, and large noses may have developed as adaptations to retain body heat and navigate the icy landscapes. Their artistic abilities and deep spirituality might have emerged as a way to find beauty and meaning in a challenging environment.
The Tactilians, living in the rocky mountains, may have evolved with physical attributes suited for rugged terrains. Their strong and sturdy physiques, along with their broad shoulders, could be adaptations for climbing and traversing the rocky landscapes. Their independent nature and martial prowess might have developed as a means of survival and defense against potential threats in their harsh surroundings.
The speed of evolution and its impact on culture would depend on various factors such as environmental pressures, resource availability, and interactions with other civilizations. It is likely that each civilization evolved at different speeds and experienced distinct cultural developments based on their unique environments and circumstances. These varying rates of evolution would contribute to the diverse cultures, traditions, and social structures observed among the civilizations of JunJia today.

The different speeds of evolution among the civilizations of JunJia have indeed had a significant impact on their current cultures. The varying rates of evolutionary change have shaped their physical attributes, societal structures, belief systems, and technological advancements in distinct ways.
For example, the Occulans, who evolved in the dense forests, may have experienced a slower rate of evolutionary change due to the relatively stable and abundant resources of their environment. This stability could have allowed them to focus more on intellectual pursuits, leading to advancements in medicine, science, and artistic expression. Their deep connection to nature and their harmonious coexistence with the forest might have fostered a culture of reverence for the natural world and a strong sense of environmental stewardship.
On the other hand, the Audorms and the Tactilians, who inhabited the challenging desert and mountainous regions respectively, might have undergone more rapid evolutionary changes. The harsh conditions and resource scarcity in these environments could have driven them to adapt quickly to survive. This could explain the Audorms' development of a strict hierarchical society and military might, as well as the Tactilians' martial prowess and emphasis on independence. Their evolutionary adaptations and cultural practices would have been geared towards overcoming the challenges of their harsh environments.
The Flarents, residing in the frozen tundras, may have experienced a unique evolutionary trajectory. The extreme cold and harsh conditions of their environment might have prompted them to adapt physically and emotionally at a faster pace. Their stocky build, thick fur, and heightened sensitivity to scent would have helped them navigate and survive in the frigid landscapes. Meanwhile, their artistic abilities and deep spirituality might have provided a means to find solace, beauty, and meaning in the challenging tundra.
These different rates of evolution have resulted in distinct cultural identities and worldviews among the civilizations of JunJia. Each civilization's unique adaptations, belief systems, and social structures are a testament to the interplay between their environmental contexts and the evolutionary pressures they faced.
